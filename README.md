# Emotions-Recognition
The project aims to detect emotions from human facial expressions. Users can capture photos or videos using an iOS application, which will then replace people's faces with emojis that represent their displayed emotions.

# Related Work
The project will implement Stanford University's research as an iOS application based on the paper available at http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/022_Report.pdf.
